# Design Document
## Game Plan:
The game will be a platformer, where the player needs to collect certain items to progress through the game. Items will also increase 
speed and abilities depending on what is picked up. The player will also have the ability to fight off enemies along the way. I plan 
to make all the visual aspects of the game through Unity, besides the textures, so the plan is to have more of a blocky look to it. I 
think in terms of audio I want to have a Minecraft vibe to the whole game so I will probably implement some chill ambient music in 
the background, and some sound effects when interacting with objects or enemies. I plan to have the player be a sea turtle and the 
game will essentially mimic a sea turtle’s journey as it hatches and makes its way towards the ocean. Along the way, the player will 
have to avoid predators, such as crabs, birds, and jellyfish, while also collecting food (seaweed) that has been scattered around. The
player will start off as a very small turtle and once it has collected a certain amount of food it will grow and keep growing while 
also increasing the turtle’s speed. There will also be garbage objects scattered around and if the player mistakes it for food it will 
decrease the size and speed by a significant amount. The player will also be operating on a timer which if they don’t reach the final 
destination, will trigger the game to be over.

## Low-bar:
A functioning platformer game with the player being able to collect food items and avoid enemies. Visually it will have everything 
built and look complete. 
## Target:
A functioning platformer game with the player being able to collect food items and avoid enemies. Visually it will have everything 
built and look complete. The player will also have the ability to shoot out “shell” objects at enemies. They will have the option to 
use the points earned collecting food to increase speed and size or to get shells as “ammo”.
## High bar:
A functioning platformer game with the player being able to collect food items and avoid enemies. Visually it will have everything 
built and look complete. The player will also have the ability to shoot out “shell” objects at enemies. They will have the option to 
use the points earned collecting food to increase speed and size or to get shells as “ammo”. If everything goes as planned I could 
also implement mini-boss levels in between and maybe even a boss level once they almost reach the end.

## Timeline:

12-6: controls and player design done along with code for how items should affect the player

12-7: design enemies and work on game layout

12-8: finish game layout

12-9: tweak controls and physics of the player based on the game layout design

12-11: implement mini-boss designs and abilities
